# Unreleased
* Spruced up the UI with a custom theme.  No more default Godot controls!
* Keys are now found inside chests, which appear when you clear the room they're in.
* A set of stairs now appears when you defeat the boss, instead of a chest.
* Fixed the "electric circuit" puzzle not being properly scrambled.
* Fixed a rare crash upon generating a dungeon, caused by the game trying to
    create a dungeon that can't be laid out with rooms overlapping each other.
    Now the game will place rooms on multiple floors in this scenario.
