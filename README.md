# Elevator pitch

Descend into the Shifting Sepulcher: a tricky tomb with a constantly-changing layout.

Solve puzzles, kill monsters, and unlock doors as you navigate your way to the dungeon's boss.  The puzzles, enemies, and layout will be different every time, so don't stop at just one play through.

Shifting Sepulcher is a procedurally-generated dungeon-crawler.  It is heavily inspired by Runescape's "dungeoneering" skill, but with core gameplay more similar to a 2D Zelda game.  Despite its procedurally-generated nature, this game is not a roguelike; there is no "permadeath", so you'll respawn when you die.  The enemies will resurrect when you die, but all doors you've opened will remain unlocked.  It's quite chill.
